## Recursively Enumerate all Links and Comments in Site

Extracts all links and comments recursively from a URL -- useful for recon and enumeration of a site, including important comments hidden away on the site itself.

#### This script only takes one argument, the url -- it should be formatted like this: http://www.thissite.com:80/ or http://192.168.0.1:8080/

#### Example use: ./lace.py http://192.168.0.1:8080/
